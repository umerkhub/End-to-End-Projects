# 🧠 End-to-End Machine Learning Project: Student Performance Predictor

This project is a complete end-to-end machine learning application built using Python, Flask, and scikit-learn. It allows users to input data through a web interface and receive real-time predictions powered by a trained ML model.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Type**: Machine Learning Web App  
- **Model**: RandomForest, LinearRegression, K-Neighbors, CatBoost, XGBoost, DecisionTree, AdaBoost
- **Framework**: Flask  
- **Deployment**: Localhost

---

## 📊 Features

- Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Custom Exception Handling and Logging
- Web Interface for User Input
- Real-Time Prediction Output
- Modular Codebase for Maintainability

## 🛠 Technologies Used

    Python

    Pandas, NumPy

    scikit-learn

    Flask

    HTML/CSS (Jinja Templates)

    Logging & Exception Handling

    Pickle (Model Serialization)


---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data is entered via a web form**.
2. **The data is converted to a DataFrame** using a custom class.
3. **The trained ML model is loaded** using a utility function.
4. **Predictions are made** and shown back to the user.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Flask
- HTML/CSS (basic front-end)
- Dill / Pickle for model serialization

---

## 🧪 Model Evaluation

Models are trained and evaluated using:
- `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning
- `R² Score` for performance evaluation
- Best model is saved and used in inference

---

## 📦 Setup Instructions

# Step 1: Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/End-to-End-ML-Project.git
cd End-to-End-ML-Project

# Step 2: Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Step 3: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 4: Run the Flask app
python app.py
